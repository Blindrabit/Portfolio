        <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To build a production standard version of the web staffing app I built previously. This will be done by using and learning about Docker for my production environment, using PostgreSQL as the database, scraping the available shifts from a portal using the Beautiful soup and asynchronous task manager with Celery while ensuring all the code is well tested. The app takes a user’s work availability as their input, scrapes the portal to update available shifts, then matches available shifts to users’ skills and availability using an algorithm.

        <p><strong>Walk through of the project</strong></p></br></br>
        I created a new Django project, and rather than using virtual env I used pipenv to track the dependencies within the piplock file. Following this I created an image using docker to act as my development environment.</br></br>
        I added a .gitignore file I used this one from github <a href="https://github.com/jpadilla/django-project-template/blob/master/.gitignore">Link</a> and added the docker-compose.yml to hold my environment variables such as debug, secret key and allowed hosts and added this to the gitignore file.</br></br>
        Once the .gitignore file was added I created a Github repository to store the code so I would be able to work on it from both my main desktop and laptop when commuting. <a href="https://github.com/Blindrabit/staffing_app_v2">Github Repository Link</a></br></br>
        Once I had created the environment to develop in, I created a custom user model as now recommended in the Dajngo documentation.

        <p>To make my log in and log functionality I used Django All Auth to create a robust authentication system and added the ability to reset passwords via an email link. The email backend is set up using the console backend but I will be utilizing Gmail SMTP.</br>

        <p>After this it was time to start adding the functionality of the website. I created a model with a form to take the time and date that each worker is available to work. <br>
            I also added a html calendar to display their availability/booked shifts in a readable format. The user is able to click on text, which will take them through to the object edit page, or to the detail page if the shift is booked. I used these instructions to guide me through this

            I plan on adding two email conformations here.<br>
                1.	Confirmation of the updated availability every time availability is added  <br>
                2.	2.	Every time the object moves from available to booked, confirmation of the shift’s details and a confirmation link to confirm the user has seen that the shift has been booked.<br>

    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>The next functionality to add was the shifts model. For this I needed more information from the users such as which hospitals and area they can work. I updated the custom user model to include a hospital field and area field and added this using a manytomany field and created models for each field. I then added the fields to the sign up form, and to make it easier for the user to select their options I added the FilteredSelectMultiple widget which I liked from the Django admin panel. I found a useful Stack Overflow post here:<A href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57820652/need-guidance-with-filteredselectmultiple-widget"target="_blank">GitHub Link</A>on how to implement them. However, this created a small issue with the field header for the following field not rendering in the correct place which this still needs to be resolved.

        <p>Once I had the correct information being captured by the sign-up process, I finished the shift model which accepted start time, end time, hospital and area. I added a simple form to accept this information. In the long term, the plan is to scrape the shift information from the customers website and automatically updated.

    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>Following this, I then wrote an algorithm to compare all available shifts and user availability and automatically book the user onto the shift whilst updating the shift information to the user. I created this by using the post_save signal when a shift is saved to trigger the function. In the future this will be added to a celery task and will run periodically to avoid slowing the website down for the users.

        <p>At this point the app may look similar to the previous version however, there have been many improvements to the structure and scalability of the app such as using a production standard database. One of the biggest improvements is the tests I have written to check the website is functioning, which will make it much easier to debug as the app grows.<br>
            <strong>Next steps:</stron><br>
            Step up a message manager and run the async tasks with Celery and Redis<br>
            Create a web scraper using thebeautifulsoup and mechinicaslsoup<br>
