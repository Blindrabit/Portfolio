    <h2>Welcome to the Django Section</h2>


    <br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>After learning basics of Python, I looked at areas I could apply the skills I had learnt to real world projects. I followed a tutorial to produce a Task List Web app.
                 This introduced me to Django and using MVC frameworks. Through this course I learnt the basics about urls, views, models and touched on using HTML to create the pages.
                 I have continued to develop my skills by adding further features to this app. <br>

            <p>I have added features to the site to change the use to a recruitment tool. The concept of the site is to allow shift workers to update their availability, 
                this is then automatically matched with available shifts needing their skill set. The first section I added calendar section where people can mark which hours they are free to work.

            <p>There is a simple profile which has user updateable information such as email, username.
                 It also holds information that the user cannot update this is used to hold information such as DBS number and which areaâ€™s they can work.

        <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>The finial section is an area for shifts to be added, this is area the user can add what kind of worker they require and the times they are needed.
                    Once a shift is added the web app checks whether there is anyone has marked themselves available to work and automatically books them to the shift.<br><br>
                    If they are booked onto the shifts it updates into their calendar to show the shift they are working.<br><br>

            <p><Strong>What do I think of the site?</Strong><br>
            I believe it was a great first attempt and shows a basic understanding of Django and MCV but I'm not happy with it. What I need to improve.<br><br>
        1. Move to Postgresql for the database<br>
        2. Use Docker for my development and production environments<br>
        3. Use custom user model<br>
        4. TESTS! Sadly when I started I did not recognise the importance of this.<br><br>
        So I am currently rebuilding the site from the ground up to do it again implementing the new best practices I have learnt since I first built the app. </p>
